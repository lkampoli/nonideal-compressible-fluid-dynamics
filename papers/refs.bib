abstract = {Steady self-similar solutions to the supersonic flow of Bethe–Zel’dovich–Thompson fluids past compressive and rarefactive ramps are derived. Inviscid, non-heat-conducting, non-reacting and single-phase vapour flow is assumed. For convex isentropes and shock adiabats in the pressure–specific volume plane (classical gas dynamic regime), the well-known oblique shock and centred Prandtl–Meyer fan occur at a compressive and rarefactive ramp, respectively. For non-convex isentropes and shock adiabats (non-classical gas dynamic regime), four additional wave configurations may possibly occur; these are composite waves in which a Prandtl–Meyer fan is adjacent up to two oblique shock waves. The steady two-dimensional counterparts of the wave curves defined for the one-dimensional Riemann problem are constructed. In the present context, such curves consist of all the possible states connected to a given initial state (namely, the uniform state upstream of the ramp/wedge) by means of a steady self-similar solution. In addition to the classical case, as many as six non-classical wave-curve configurations are singled out. Moreover, the necessary conditions leading to each type of wave curves are analysed and a map of the upstream states leading to each configuration is determined.},

abstract = {Non-ideal gases refer to deformable substances in which the speed of sound can decrease following an isentropic compression. This may occur near a phase transition such as the liquid–vapour critical point due to long-range molecular interactions. Isentropes can then become locally concave in the pressure/specific-volume phase diagram (e.g. Bethe–Zel’dovich–Thompson (BZT) gases). Following the pioneering work of Bethe (Tech. Rep. 545, Office of Scientific Research and Development, 1942) on shocks in non-ideal gases, this paper explores the refraction properties of stable compression shocks in non-reacting but arbitrary substances featuring a positive isobaric volume expansivity. A small-perturbation analysis is carried out to obtain analytical expressions for the thermo-acoustic properties of the refracted field normal to the shock front. Three new regimes are discovered: (i) an extensive but selective (in upstream Mach numbers) amplification of the entropy mode (hundreds of times larger than those of a corresponding ideal gas); (ii) discontinuous (in upstream Mach numbers) refraction properties following the appearance of non-admissible portions of the shock adiabats; (iii) the emergence of a phase shift for the generated acoustic modes and therefore the existence of conditions for which the perturbed shock does not produce any acoustic field (i.e. ‘quiet’ shocks, to contrast with the spontaneous D’yakov–Kontorovich acoustic emission expected in 2D or 3D). In the context of multidimensional flows, and compressible turbulence in particular, these results demonstrate a variety of pathways by which a supplied amount of energy (in the form of an entropy, vortical or acoustic mode) can be redistributed in the form of other entropy, acoustic and vortical modes in a manner that is simply not achievable in ideal gases. These findings are relevant for turbines and compressors operating close to the liquid–vapour critical point (e.g. organic Rankine cycle expanders, supercritical $\text{CO}_{2}$ compressors), astrophysical flows modelled as continuum media with exotic equations of state (e.g. the early Universe) or Bose–Einstein condensates with small but finite temperature effects.},

abstract = {The morphology of nodes generated by the interaction of discontinuities in steady two-dimensional inviscid flows is examined. The fluids considered are Bethe–Zel’dovich–Thompson (BZT) fluids, which feature negative values of the fundamental derivative of gas dynamics in the vapour phase. The operating conditions correspond to the non-classical gas-dynamic regime where expansion shocks, compression fans and composite waves are admissible in addition to the classical compression shocks and expansion fans. Interactions caused by the crossing, overtaking and splitting of compression/expansion shocks, along with the refraction of these through a contact discontinuity, are analysed here. The well-established method of wave curves is applied to non-classical wave curves, revealing a variety of interaction patterns that are simply not admissible in classical gas dynamics. It is shown that shock waves can be reflected, transmitted and refracted as Prandtl–Meyer fans or composite waves. Based on numerical evidence, the splitting (and consequently the Mach reflection) of an expansion shock seems to be disallowed. Theoretical considerations on the admissibility of such configurations are also provided. The present analysis is relevant to applications potentially involving supersonic flows of BZT fluids, e.g. organic Rankine cycle power systems, and can also be used in front-tracking algorithms for general equations of state.},

This non-ideal behaviour is primarily associated with a less-than-unity value of the fundamental derivative of gasdynamics and, therefore, non-ideal shock waves are expected to be observed in flows of fluids with moderate molecular complexity. The simple yet qualitatively sound van der Waals model is used to confirm the present findings and to provide exemplary non-ideal shock waves.},

abstract = {From the analysis of the isentropic limit of weak compression shock waves, oblique shock waves in which the post-shock Mach number is larger than the pre-shock Mach number, named non-ideal oblique shocks, are admissible in substances characterized by moderate molecular complexity and in the close proximity to the liquid–vapour saturation curve. Non-ideal oblique shocks of finite amplitude are systematically analysed, clarifying the roles of the pre-shock thermodynamic state and Mach number. The necessary conditions for the occurrence of non-ideal oblique shocks of finite amplitude are singled out. In the parameter space of pre-shock thermodynamic states and Mach number, a new domain is defined which embeds the pre-shock states for which the Mach number increase can possibly take place. The present findings are confirmed by state-of-the-art thermodynamic models applied to selected commercially available fluids, including siloxanes and hydrocarbons currently used as working fluids in renewable energy systems.},

abstract = {A nonlinear spectral model in terms of spherically averaged descriptors is derived for the prediction of homogeneous turbulence dynamics in the presence of arbitrary mean-velocity gradients. The governing equations for the tensor $\hat{\unicode[STIX]{x1D619}}_{ij}(\boldsymbol{k},t)$ , the Fourier transform of the two-point second-order correlation tensor, are first closed by an anisotropic eddy-damped quasinormal Markovian procedure. This closure is restricted to turbulent flows where linear effects induced by mean-flow gradients have no essential qualitative effects on the dynamics of triple correlations compared with the induced production effects in the equations for second-order correlations. Truncation at the first relevant order of spectral angular dependence allows us to derive from these equations in vector $\boldsymbol{k}$ our final model equations in terms of the wavenumber modulus $k$ only. Analytical spherical integration results in a significant decrease in computational cost. Besides, the model remains consistent with the decomposition in terms of directional anisotropy and polarization anisotropy, with a spherically averaged anisotropic spectral tensor for each contribution. Restriction of anisotropy to spherically averaged descriptors, however, entails a loss of information, and realizability conditions are considered to quantify the upper boundary of anisotropy that can be investigated with the proposed model. Several flow configurations are considered to assess the validity of the present model. Satisfactory agreement with experiments on grid-generated turbulence subjected to successive plane strains is observed, which confirms the capability of the model to account for production of anisotropy by mean-flow gradients. The nonlinear transfer terms of the model are further tested by considering the return to isotropy (RTI) of different turbulent flows. Different RTI rates for directional anisotropy and polarization anisotropy allow us to correctly predict the apparent delayed RTI shown after axisymmetric expansion. The last test case deals with homogeneous turbulence subjected to a constant pure plane shear. The interplay between linear and nonlinear effects is reproduced, yielding the eventual exponential growth of the turbulent kinetic energy.},

abstract = {Steady nozzle flows of Bethe–Zel’dovich–Thompson fluids – substances exhibiting non-classical gasdynamic behaviour in a finite vapour-phase thermodynamic region in close proximity to the liquid–vapour saturation curve – are examined. Non-classical flow features include rarefaction shock waves, shock waves with either upstream or downstream sonic states and split shocks. Exact solutions for a mono-component single-phase fluid expanding from a reservoir into a stationary atmosphere through a conventional converging–diverging nozzle are determined within the quasi-one-dimensional inviscid flow approximation. The novel analytical approach makes it possible to elucidate the connection between the adiabatic, possibly non-isentropic flow field and the underlying local isentropic-flow features, including the possible qualitative alterations in passing through shock waves. Contrary to previous predictions based on isentropic-flow inspection, shock disintegration is found to occur also from reservoir states corresponding to a single sonic point. The global layout of the flow configurations produced by a monotonic decrease in the ambient pressure, namely the functioning regime, is examined for reservoir conditions resulting in single-phase flows. Accordingly, a classification of steady nozzle flows into 10 different functioning regimes is proposed. Flow conditions determining the transition between the different classes of flow are investigated and each functioning regime is associated with the corresponding thermodynamic region of reservoir states.},
